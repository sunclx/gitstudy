Statistical graphics are powerful -- your eyes will jump to the graph below immediately and skip this paragraph automatically. When we see a nice graph, we often wonder how it was made (e.g. [this one](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12675147/559676) via xkcd).

Vistat aims to provide _working_ recipes for statistical graphics by building them from source. The website is based on Github/Jekyll, and graphs are generated dynamically through the R package [**knitr**](http://yihui.name/knitr), hence reproducibility is guaranteed, and readers can see the source code at the same time.
