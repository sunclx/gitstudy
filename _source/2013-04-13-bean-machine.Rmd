The bean machine, also known as the quincunx or Galton box, is a device invented by Sir [Francis
Galton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton) to demonstrate the [Central Limit
Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), in particular that the Normal
distribution is approximated from the Binomial distribution, or properly speaking, [de
Moivreâ€“Laplace theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Moivre%E2%80%93Laplace_theorem).

The function `quincunx()` in the [**animation** package](http://yihui.name/animation) shows you how
balls bounce left and right as they hit the pins. You can see the height of ball columns in the
bins approximates a [bell curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).
