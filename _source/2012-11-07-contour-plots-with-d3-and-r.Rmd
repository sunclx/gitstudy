[D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) is a popular JavaScript library to draw graphics on the web.
Powerful as it is, I often feel it is limited to me as a statistician, especially a statistician
spoiled by [R](http://www.r-project.org) -- in which I can draw plots without thinking of
primitives such as points, lines, segments and so on, and all kinds of statistical functions are
there for me to call. In this article I explain how to combine R and D3 to draw a contour plot.

## Computing in R

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Mount_Eden.jpg/320px-Mount_Eden.jpg)

The computation of contour lines can be challenging to JavaScript but is extremely easy with R
using the `contourLines()` function, so we pre-process the data and make it ready to JavaScript. We
make use of the good old `volcano` dataset here and draw a contour plot to visualize the altitude
corresponding to a grid of latitudes and longitudes (the picture above of the volcano is from
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Eden)).

```{r prepare-data}
res = contourLines(volcano)
str(res[1:2])  # first two elements of the list
```

We can see the results returned by `contourLines()` is a list of sub-lists: each sub-list contains
the x-y coordinates of polylines. Now we convert this list to a JSON array of the form:

{% highlight js %}
[
{
  "x": [0, 0, 0, ...],
  "y": [0, 0, 0, ...]
},
{
  "x": [0, 0, 0, ...],
  "y": [0, 0, 0, ...]
},
...
]
{% endhighlight %}

And write the data to a `script` tag:

```{r write-data, results='asis', dependson='prepare-data'}
xy = paste(unlist(lapply(res, function(z) {
  xs = paste(round(z$x, 3), collapse = ',')
  ys = paste(round(z$y, 3), collapse = ',')
  sprintf('{\n  "x": [%s],\n  "y": [%s]\n}', xs, ys)
})), collapse = ', \n')
cat('<script>',
    sprintf('var data = [%s]', xy),
    '</script>',
    sep = '\n')
```

## Draw lines in D3

Now we are ready to call D3 to draw all the lines (see the HTML source code of this page):

<script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v2.min.js">
</script>

<div id="volcano" style="text-align: center;"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
var width = 500, height = 300;

var x = d3.scale.linear()
    .domain([0, 1])
    .range([0, width]);

var y = d3.scale.linear()
    .domain([0, 1])
    .range([height, 0]);

var line = d3.svg.line()
    .x(function(d) { return x(d.x); })
    .y(function(d) { return y(d.y); });

var svg = d3.select("#volcano").append("svg")
    .attr("width", width)
    .attr("height", height)
    .selectAll("path")
      .data(data.map(function(d) {
        return d3.range(d.x.length).map(function(i) {
          return {x: d.x[i], y: d.y[i]};
        });
      }))
    .enter().append("svg:path")
      .attr("d", line)
      .on("mouseover", function(d, i) {
        d3.select(this).style("stroke", "yellow");
      })
      .on("mouseout", function(d, i) {
        d3.select(this).style("stroke", "darkgreen");
      })
      .style("fill", "none")
      .style("stroke", "darkgreen")
      .style("stroke-width", 0)
      .transition()
      .duration(10000)
      .style("stroke-width", 2);
</script>

This is indeed a plot drawn by D3; if you do not believe it, mouse over the lines and you will see
them highlighted in yellow, or refresh this page to see line width transition from 0 to 2.

With R, it is just one line of code but it is a static plot (not interactive):

```{r contour-r, echo=2, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(2, 4, .1, .1))
contour(volcano, col = 'darkgreen', lwd = 2)
```

## Conclusion

It is rare that we solve a problem with a single tool. Take the advantages of all tools instead of
blindly believing that one ring will rule them all. R is good for statistical computing and
graphics, and D3 is awesome for the web. Both are good in one way but weak in another, so let's
make `1 + 1 > 2`.
