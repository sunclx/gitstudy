We can use the [**animation** package](http://yihui.name/animation) to produce animations in R.
This short article shows you how to create a Brownian motion with the `brownian.motion()` function.

Simply speaking, a Brownian motion shows the trace of the coordinates

$$x_{i+1}=x_{i}+\epsilon_{i+1}$$

where $\epsilon_i$ is i.i.d from a standard Normal distribution. That is fairly easy to program in
R -- it is nothing but `cumsum(rnorm(n))`, and that is what `brownian.motion()` does internally.

```{r bw-fun, fig.show='animate', interval=.2, fig.height=5}
library(animation)
ani.options(nmax = 50)  # create 50 image frames
set.seed(20121106)
brownian.motion(n = 20, pch = 21, cex = 4, col = "red", bg = "yellow",
                xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim = c(-15, 15))
```

Done.
